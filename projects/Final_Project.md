## Project Objective
### The problem: 
Many UH computer science and engineering students want to learn about internship and job opportunities, but currently they must wait until a company decides to visit the campus or send out some sort of announcement. There is no efficient way for students to understand the “landscape” of internship and job opportunities that might be available in the future, so they can prepare for them now.

### The solution: 
The Company Connector web application provides a new way for local and non-local companies who want to recruit students from UH to make their (potential) opportunities known to students. At the same time, students can create profiles on the site with their interests. The site can match students to employers and vice-versa.

## My Responsibility 
### My Responsibility during this project was to:
- Create the student and company home page
- Create a login/signup system for Different Users 
- Create Pages to show student and company profiles using user given profile data

### Example of the Student Home Page

## What I learned 
In this project I was able to learn how to use React, Bootstrap, and MongoDB to create a web application. I was able to learn how to use Boostrap and React together to create a user interface that a user could easily use to navigate the web application we built. This web application used MongoDB as a database and I was able to learn how to add collections to this database. Futhermore, I was able to pull data from this database and use this data to generate user profiles based on the given data. Most imporantantly I was able to learn the software engineering concepts needed to create a fully functioning web application.
