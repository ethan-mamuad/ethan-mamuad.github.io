<h2 id="i-introduction">I. Introduction</h2>
<p>In this class we have learned a lot about web applications and how we can build them to our needs, but software engineering in general can be branched out into many different concepts from open source software development to ethics in software engineering. I will reflect on some concepts of software engineering and will discuss what they mean beyond the realm of web application development.</p>

<h2 id="ii-coding-standards">II. Coding Standards</h2>
<p>First off, what are coding standards in terms of software engineering? Well, coding standards can be seen as standards that will be used when coding so that the code is more efficient, easier to read and understand, and facilitates collaboration between developers. This is what coding standards are when we are talking about web application development and software engineering. Coding standards can be used beyond web application development since it can be seen as a universal concept regarding software development. For example, coding standards were very useful when I was coding my final project for our web application. Furthermore, I can still use these coding standards in code that is unrelated to web application development because it will still be useful and help my code to be of higher quality no matter what the project may be.</p>

<h2 id="iii--development-environments">III.  Development Environments</h2>
<p>Development environments can be defined as an environment or workspace where a set of processes or tools can be used to develop code for an application. This is very important when coding because the development environment determines how the code will be written and how efficient the development process will be. Integrated development environments (IDEs) can be very useful not only for web application development, but for development within any focus of software engineering. This is because IDEs help the user to edit, build, test, and package code all in one place. Moreover, this makes the coding process much more efficient since everything you need is all in one place.</p>

<h2 id="iv-user-interface-frameworks">IV. User Interface Frameworks</h2>
<p>User interface frameworks can be defined as a collection of predefined/prebuilt components, libraries, and design elements that allows reusability for users when creating user interfaces. A framework that I used for my final project is a framework called bootstrap which really helped me to design the user interface much more efficiently. As for using these frameworks for things other than web application development, I can see them being useful as well. This is because making a user interface from scratch can take a lot of time especially if you have to reuse an element you previously used. By using a user interface framework you can create a user interface more efficiently and this doesnâ€™t just apply to web application development.</p>

<h2 id="v-conclusion">V. Conclusion</h2>
<p>To conclude, in this class we have learned a lot about web applications and how we can build them to our needs, but in general we learned a lot about software engineering. We were able to reflect on coding standards, development environments, and user interface frameworks. We were able to look at these 3 concepts in the context of web application development, and how these 3 concepts can be applied in other contexts that are not web application development. Overall, software engineering has many concepts, and while I was able to learn a decent amount of concepts in this class I still have much more to learn and hope this will help to explain some of the many concepts of software engineering.</p>
