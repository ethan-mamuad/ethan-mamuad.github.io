  <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>When coding there is always the ability to code freely in any way that you like, but coding standards actually help to create better code. For example, does adding an extra space or indentation really help in the long run when coding or does it hinder one’s ability to code at a faster pace. For me I have never really followed a coding standard when coding as I would just write the code and try to make it as nice as possible. Moreover, when using ESLint you are forced to code by specific coding standards that make your code nice as well. So are coding standards really helpful or are they just for show. In this essay I will explain in detail my experience using ESLint, and will cover why I think coding standards are important.</p>
<h2 id="my-experience">My Experience</h2>
<p>After using ESLint for the first time I thought it was really annoying to get a bunch of errors even though there were really no errors in actual code but more with the formatting of it. I have never really gone by coding standards before such as using ESLint so when I get errors I originally thought my code was wrong due to these errors. In reality my code was fine and I learned that the errors that I was getting were a result of things such as declaring a function, but not using the function. After this experience I was able to learn that ESLint is always sweeping my code for errors such as this even though I plan to use the function later, so I will get red errors even if the code is correct. Furthermore, I think having ESLint can be annoying to have when writing my code. I have to fix a bunch of indentation/format errors which take away from me trying to code the solution to the problem . For example, I feel as if I were to write my code first and then have it checked for errors using ESLint. It wouldn’t be as annoying to deal with. Moreover, at least I feel satisfied when I am able to fix all the errors and get a green check mark.</p>
<h2 id="why-coding-standards-are-important">Why Coding Standards Are Important</h2>
<p>On the other hand I do believe that these coding standards are important as they really help to improve readability and maintainability of the code, especially if everyone uses the same standards to code. I also think by using a coding standard you are able to detect bugs within your code easier. Even though this is true I do believe that if different coding standards are used it can be hard to read someone else’s code. This is because if you are used to a certain coding standard then reading someone else’s code who uses a different standard might be hard to follow.</p>
<h2 id="coding-standards-in-professional-environments">Coding Standards In Professional Environments</h2>
<p>As for coding standards I also believe that they are very useful when used in a professional setting. For example, when you are coding a big project and you have multiple different people working on this project with their own code. If no one were to follow a coding standard and everyone just coded in whatever way they wanted then it would be hard to follow the code especially if all the code is collectively being put together. This is where coding standards can be helpful, because people can create their own code, but have them structured in a way where everyone knows how to read it. This is crucial because now all the code in the project is read in the same way, even though different people coded a different part of the project.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Throughout this essay we have talked about my experience with coding standards and ESLint, why coding standards are good/not ideal, and how coding standards can be useful professionally. What coding standards to go by is an entirely different question, but,  I personally would recommend using something like ESLint to code with coding standards but in the end it is up to you what you want to do when you create your code. Like I said in the beginning there is always the ability to code freely in any way you like. Furthermore, if you decide that for your code it isn’t necessary to go by the coding standards then don’t, but if you think it will help your code then I say you should.</p>
