  <h2 id="i-introduction">I. Introduction</h2>
<p>In this essay, we will take a look at my experience with using javascript for the first time and address what I think about the coding language. We will also be reflecting on the learning style in the class ICS 314 at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, where athletic software engineering is used.
This paper will be organized as follows. Section II will go into detail about how I feel about javascript, how it compares to other programming languages, and whether it is a good programming language from the standpoint of a software engineer. Section III will go into detail about the learning style of the ICS 314 class and will briefly cover athletic software engineering, WODs, and what I think about this learning style. Finally, in Section IV we will tie everything together with the conclusion.</p>

<h2 id="ii-javascript">II. Javascript</h2>

<h3 id="iia-how-do-i-feel-about-javascript">II.A. How do I feel about javascript</h3>
<p>I think javascript so far is like any other programming language I have used so far and there are very small differences. After going through the freecodecamp javascript courses I have a better understanding about how javascript works, but I think it is a relatively easy programming language to learn in my opinion.</p>

<h3 id="iib-how-does-javascript-compare-to-other-programming-languages">II.B. How does javascript compare to other programming languages</h3>
<p>I have used multiple languages through my time here at UH Manoa such as C, C++, and Python, while having some experience with Java in highschool. Javascript has a C style syntax which makes it very similar to some of the other languages I have mentioned. It is different in a way as it is used for scripting language rather than programming. Overall, I see most programming languages to be similar in a way, the main thing that makes the language seem different from the others is the way you use the language and what the language is being used for.</p>

<h3 id="iic-things-i-learned">II.C. Things I learned</h3>
<p>I have learned some new things especially from the ES6 portion of javascript, such as array and object destructuring, and promises. These are features that I thought were interesting and do not include some other programming languages. For example, the promises feature helps to fulfill either resolve or reject for an asynchronous operation, and is something very new to me. The destructuring of arrays and objects really helps because now we donâ€™t need temporary variables.</p>

<h3 id="iid-is-javascript-a-good-programming-language">II.D. Is Javascript a good programming language</h3>
<p>I think javascript is a good programming language because it is easy to learn and is dynamically typed. From the standpoint of a software engineer this is important because having it statically typed will make variables unable to change type. For example, If we were to declare a variable as a string it would stay a string if it were statically typed, but if its dynamically typed, there is no declaration of type so we can change its type dynamically.</p>

<h2 id="iii-learning-style">III. Learning Style</h2>

<h3 id="iiia-athletic-software-engineering">III.A. Athletic Software Engineering</h3>
<p>So far I think that athletic software engineering is stressful and a lot of work, but this helps me to start my work which is always the hardest part for me when doing work in general. For example, when you work for any job I feel like the hardest part is getting yourself to go to work, but after you are there you are focused and can get the job done. I personally think that this style will work for me because getting motivated to do something is alway difficult for me.</p>

<h3 id="iiib-practice-wods">III.B. Practice WODs</h3>
<p>As for practice WODs, I think they are a good way to get practice on content. The main reason I really like the WODs is because I know how long I am supposed to take on the WOD and if I finish over that amount of time then I know something is wrong. This is really important to me because I always overthink problems and end up taking forever to complete a problem when it should only take X amount of time to complete.</p>

<h2 id="iv-conclusion">IV. Conclusion</h2>
<p>Throughout this essay, we have covered many topics including javascript and the athletic software engineering style used in ICS 314. I was able to reflect on what I personally thought about javascript, how it compares to other programming languages, things I learned, and if javascript is a good programming language.  Furthermore, I was also able to reflect on the athletic software engineering style and the use of WODs to create a style of learning similar to an athlete where the training is taken seriously so they can perform the best they can during gametime. Overall, I was able to learn about javascript which is a language I have never learned before, and better understand the process of the athletic software engineering style to further improve how I learn.</p>
