## I. Introduction 
With the use of AI becoming prevalent in recent years, it can be seen that AI has become a huge topic especially regarding the ethics surrounding it. For example, there are AI models that can create a picture from a description using words as well as ChatGPT which uses AI to best answer a question. Furthemore, AI has had a huge impact on education since students can now just type in the question to their problem with an AI application or just use it to help them if they are stuck and need some assistance. For example, AI can help with software engineering as AI is able to generate code based on a given description just like with pictures. Some examples of these AI applications include, github copilot, ChatGPT, Bard, etc. Even though some may choose to use AI to assist them, I choose not to, and in this essay I will explain why I choose not to use AI even though it is a helpful and readily available resource.  

## II. Personal Experience with AI
### Experience WODs e.g. E18
I have not used AI for Experience WODs because I feel like these WODs are meant to be done with what is given to you, and especially because there is a time limit. Furthermore, AI will limit your time to actually do the WOD.
### In-class Practice WODs
I have not used AI for In-Class Practice WODs because I feel like these WODs are meant to be done with what is given to you, and especially because there is a time limit. Furthermore, AI will limit your time to actually do the WOD.
### In-class WODs
I have not used AI for In-Class Practice WODs because I feel like these WODs are meant to be done with what is given to you, and especially because there is a time limit. Furthermore, AI will limit your time to actually do the WOD.
### Essays
I have not used AI for Essays because usually for my classes I am given certain guidelines and I can’t be reliant on AI to write an Essay with those certain guidelines. Even if it can write an Essay with those certain guidelines I feel like having your own writing style is an important skill to have. 
### Final project
I have not used AI for the final project because I want to use everything I have learned from this class to complete the project. If I just put a prompt into an AI app It would most likely not give me what I am looking for or use code that can be confusing or take away from what needs to be done.
### Learning a concept / tutorial
I have not used AI for learning a concept/tutorial because I usually just do a google search instead to see what I can find on a specific topic.I could probably use AI here, but I am fine just using a search engine such as google. 
### Answering a question in class or in Discord
I have not used AI for answering a question in class or in Discord because I feel like I can use google to find a solution or answer to my question, and if I can’t find it there then I think it is better to ask the class discord because that probably means the question most likely can’t be answered by AI. 
### Asking or answering a smart-question
I have not used AI for asking smart questions because like I said previously I could just pull up a browser or forum and find the answer I am looking for.
### Coding example e.g. “give an example of using Underscore .pluck”
I have not used AI for asking smart questions because like I said previously I could just pull up a browser or forum and find the answer I am looking for.
### Explaining code
I have not used AI for explaining code, because I feel like reading the code and dissecting it myself helps me to understand and learn the code better because I have to look up things that I don’t know so that I know the next time. 
### Writing code
I have not used AI for writing code because if AI could write my code for me then why not just use AI to code everything instead. By writing code on my own I am able to write specific code for whatever the reason may be, while AI might be unreliable in what it is able to write. 
### Documenting code
I have not used AI for documenting code because I usually like to have my notes personalized to my coding style because it will help me and other people to understand exactly what I did while AI might not understand the right documentation to apply. 
### Quality assurance e.g. What’s wrong with this code or Fix the ESLint errors in code
I have not used AI for quality assurance because debugging to me is a very important skill to have. If I tell AI to debug this code for me and it works I’ll probably just move on and not know how to fix it if I didn't have AI. I can learn to debug properly by not using AI for quality assurance. 
### Other uses in ICS 314 not listed
I have not used AI for other uses in ICS 314 not listed because I feel like it is a powerful tool./resource, but I usually just do a google search and can find the answers I need with that. Moreover, I don’t feel the need to use AI to assist me in programming as I feel like I learn better when I am able to find the solution myself since AI isn’t always reliable. 


## III. Impact on Learning and Understanding
The influence of AI hasn't really affected my learning experience because I don’t usually use AI to do anything. I usually just do a google search to find what I am looking for and then learn from what I find when searching. I feel like it just depends on the person but for me I feel as if I learn better when I do things myself, rather than having AI hand deliver me the answer I am looking for. For example, comprehension, skill development, and problem-solving abilities suffer if I don’t know the process in which a solution was found since I would just get the answer and move on without thinking about it. 

## IV. Practical Applications
 I believe that AI has many practical applications that can be really helpful such as AI apps that can help with repetitive tasks or anything that AI can do to save time for a software engineer. AI has been used in real-world projects such as Github Copilot which helps with the coding process for software engineers. I think AI applications definitely help with addressing real-world software engineering challenges, as it saves time which can be very helpful when coding a big project and make the coding process a lot smoother. 
 
## V. Challenges and Opportunities
I would not be able to identify any challenges or limitations you have encountered in the use of AI within the course because I have never used AI at all in this course. As for potential opportunities for further integration of AI in software engineering education, I would say AI could be used to give example situations as these can be helpful to the learning process. This can help the learning process because by having an example situation you are able to learn what to do if that example situation becomes a real situation. 

## VI. Comparative Analysis
As for traditional teaching methods and AI-enhanced approaches in the context of software engineering education. I believe that AI-enhanced approaches can work as long as the students are learning something and are able to go through the learning process step by step. I feel like AI-enhanced approaches will have more engagement, less knowledge retention, and less practical skill development than traditional teaching methods, but it can still be effective at teaching students in the context of software engineering. 

## VII. Future Considerations
 I believe that AI can have a very big impact on software engineering education in the future, but it really depends on if AI is used in the right way. Moreover, even though AI is a really good tool and resource to use if it isn’t used correctly it can lead to drawbacks especially in the context of software engineering education. Potential advancements could include step by step AI, and challenges and areas of improvement could include the reliability of AI.

## VIII. Conclusion
So far we have gone over my thoughts regarding AI and its use in the context of software engineering, but what do you think?, should we transition over to AI-enhanced learning or should we just stick to the traditional way of learning. I suggest that AI should be used since it is such a powerful tool, but it should be used in the right way going forward if we really want to utilize AI in education efficiently. For example, AI can be used to give certain example scenarios which the student will have to go through and through these scenarios they will be able to learn what to do in that specific situation. Furthermore, I feel like it will depend on what the student thinks is a better way to learn since different people learn in different ways so it really just depends how effective AI will be to a specific person.
