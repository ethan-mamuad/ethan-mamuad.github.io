## I. Introduction
Ever since I was a child I always enjoyed building legos and at the moment this may seem irrelevant to the topic, but this is what got me into computers and technology in the first place. This led to me being interested in engineering since it was similar to this lego building I used to do, because as with programs you build them by parts then combine them all together to create something bigger.

## II. My Interests in Software Engineering
As for interests in software engineering I would say I am interested in big data, containerization, and networking. These are topics I thought were interesting and what I think will only improve in the future. For example, after taking my networking class, one of the things that stuck with me from that class was how badly structured the internet is in general, but somehow it all works. This made me realize there is still so much for the internet to be improved which is what interested me in networking. As for big data, and containerization I thought it was a cool way to package applications in a way that could run on any infrastructure that could support containers, without looking at the operating system. 

## III. Skills/Experiences I Hope to Develop
As a computer engineering student I am not purely focused on software engineering, but I still have many skills/experiences I hope to develop in the future.  Regarding software engineering I want to learn as many skills as I can because as technology evolves some skills will become obsolete while new skills will open up. If I had to be specific though, I would want to be skillful at using most of the popular programming languages and be able to become more skillful at working with containerization softwares such as docker. As for experiences I would want to work on a project involving a new technology or new concept as I think it would be very interesting to work on since it would be something completely brand new.
