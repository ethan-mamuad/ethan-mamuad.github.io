<h2 id="i-introduction">I. Introduction</h2>
<p>We may all have heard of the term structural support before and if you havenâ€™t it can be defined as the framework that holds up a structure. This structural support is responsible for upholding a building or structure so it is stable and safe for people to be in. This can very well relate to the design patterns that you may experience when writing up code whether it be for a project or just a small part of something bigger.</p>

<h2 id="ii-design-patterns-vs-structural-support">II. Design patterns vs. Structural Support</h2>
<p>We can relate a design pattern to the structural support of a building since a design pattern is able to uphold or provide transparency and organization to the code and gives the code some ground to work on and stand on its own. Without these design patterns it would be hard to know how everything is organized and designed and it would be like a building without structural support as everything would collapse since there is no support to uphold the building or tell it how it should stand. Furthermore, the design patterns used in coding and software engineering are what uphold the code in the project to ensure everything is in check and is more flexible and maintainable since it has that support to go off of.</p>

<h2 id="iii-advantages-of-design-patterns">III. Advantages of Design Patterns</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Reusability of pattern in multiple projects</li>
  <li>Transparency to the design of a project</li>
  <li>Enhanced Organization and Clarity</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="iv-disadvantages-of-design-patterns">IV. Disadvantages of Design Patterns</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Cannot address specific issues</li>
  <li>Certain level of expertise is needed</li>
  <li>Failed implementation of patterns can hurt more than help</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="v-structural-support-in-my-code">V. Structural Support in my Code</h2>
<p>A good example of structural support/design patterns that I use in my code is the separation or organization of code based on the problem at hand. By having this structure of organizing files of code by its use of similarity to other files can help to navigate to other files in the project easier. For example, if we encounter a bug in the code and see it is due to a certain component of the code, we just need to look at that component, and branch out the components in that component to further simplify or deduce the problem. This can be a very useful structural support for when I code and this is just one of the many different design patterns that can be implemented into your code.</p>

<h2 id="viconclusion">VI.Conclusion</h2>
<p>To conclude one can see the need for design patterns in software engineering as it is able to provide many benefits similar to that of the structural support of a building or structure. Even though design patterns have their advantages and disadvantages it is important to know that if used in the right way design patterns can help to improve the quality of code. Overall, I recommend that you find the design patterns that work in your code and use them to your advantage because in the long run it will make the structure so much more stable.</p>
